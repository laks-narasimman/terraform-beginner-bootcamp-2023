## Terraform mock server

download the server using [git link](https://github.com/ExamProCo/terratowns_mock_server)
Once the server is downaloded, we see a folder called 'terratowns_mock_server'

**Need to make sure that the `.git` folder is removed uder this directory as it is not supposed to be committed**
